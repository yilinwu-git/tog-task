# tog-task

The is an React app, please run the app in the development mode with npm start script. 


 ## Solutions:

 - Fully responsive page.

 - Fetching mock data using axios.

 - Responsive navbar and slide in nav in mobile view.

 - I use an image-not-found placceholder for "2 Angel Square" because there is no image available in mock data.

 - there are warnings in console. When rendering a list of items, the best practice is using id from fetching data as a key prop. 'id' is not available in mock data in this task.

 - I only use bootstrap components Card and Table for effciently complete this task. Other than these, all the stylings are done with vanilla CSS (Sass).

 - This task was deploy to Vercel.
